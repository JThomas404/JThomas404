**About Me**
---
My name is Jarred, and I am a South African with a deep passion for technology. From a young age, I embraced my role as the family's go-to "problem solver," whether it was fixing the TV or optimising the home Wi-Fi router. This problem-solving passion shaped my identity and led me to a career in technology.

At 18, fresh out of high school and with no prior IT experience, I embarked on an internship at Lorge Consulting Services. There, I gained hands-on experience with VoIP phones, user PC setups, server configurations, and troubleshooting Cisco routers, switches, and APs.

Today, I am dedicated to refining my skills as a network engineer and find joy in troubleshooting and fixing computer networks. I continually enhance my knowledge through platforms like LinkedIn Learning and Udemy, and through hands-on labs such as NetSim and my home lab. These experiences have been crucial in honing my problem-solving abilities.

My journey has led me to become a Cisco Certified Network Associate, specialising in Local Area Networks (LAN) and routing and switching protocols. My natural problem-solving skills align seamlessly with the complexities of network engineering, allowing me to address and resolve issues with precision.

Now, I am expanding my expertise by pursuing a career as an AWS Cloud Engineer. I showcase all my labs, code, projects, and hands-on experience on my GitHub profile, including network engineering labs and cloud computing projects. This reflects my ongoing commitment to learning and growth, as well as my excitement about the dynamic field of technology, where each challenge is a puzzle waiting to be solved and each solution a step forward.
